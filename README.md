# AlbumList
Recommendations for the future

·         Use API that provides images for the album covers for an improved UI. Some users may know an album’s cover but not its name, providing the cover art would help these users find what they are looking for.

·         Implementing a search bar feature could help users find the album they are looking for faster.

·         Creating a favourites tab where users could save the albums they like would be good, to avoid having the users have to scroll through a long list to find the albums they like.

·         Implementing an onClickListener to the RecyclerView so when a user clicks on an album they are presented with a track list for the album they clicked on.

·         Implement a filter so the user can break down the list into a smaller more manageable list using something like ‘Genre’.
